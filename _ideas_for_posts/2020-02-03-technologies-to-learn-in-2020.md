The difference of being overchallenged and too comfortable is easy to miss. 
I decided that things *have* got too comfortable for me.
This has various reasons:
- I discovered a passion for creative endeavors like theatre, singing and [photography](/)
- My learning was focused on classes in university
- Workmatters led me to broadaning my assets in various areas like [Machine Learning](https://github.com/adessoag/facenality) and [DevOps](https://www.adesso.de/de/news/blog/deploy-keras-models-to-production-level-easily.jsp)

## Self-Education
tl;dr -> [Take me to your study schedule](#study-schedule-2020).

Recent events led me to the conclusion that sharpening specific skills is a task for myself.
You will grow at work and university.
You can not expect to learn *all* the interesting things there though.

I also figured that 
- the idea of creating a product that benefits people
- in sprints of one to eight weeks

drives my work to it's best.

There's even scientific backup for that - 
Delays bear threat of loosing interest and feeling overwhelmed.
> Our perception of difficulty scales with the time available.

Weekly [personal sprints](https://maketime.blog/article/redesign-your-day-four-lessons-from-the-design-sprint-laboratory/) can ensure motivation and focus on the task.
The following is a compilation of my personal (tech) schedule for 2020.
