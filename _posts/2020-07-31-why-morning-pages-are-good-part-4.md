Part four tells the story of reflection, humility and responsibility.
We explore the power of our actions and shun all trace of victimhood.
I hope you're not sick of mindfulness yet ðŸ˜œ

# "Take a minute to reflect" - 25.07.2020 
**I feel**.. satisfied, because I realized what makes Morning Pages beneficial.
There's a bit of a story behind it:

Yesterday was a mediocre evening.
I went out for drinks with a small group of people.
Though I was really looking forward to it, things didn't go as expected.
The group dynamic was low and cool.
There was occasional group chat, but a lot of the time was spent in uncomfortable two on two dialogs.
I tried my best to break the ice and engage a shared conversation.
Needless to say that I got increasingly aggravated as things didn't get better.
My relief to go home was saddeningly great.

As I woke up the next day, I was still tangled in the night's events.
Something was nagging on me, but I couldn't put my finger on it.
I found my peace as I started writing the Morning Pages.
Expressing my unfiltered opinion to an unbiased listener was soothing.
The writing helped me verbalize what bothered me about yesternight's events:
**It was not only the group dynamic, but also my own behavior.**
As I took responsibility and apologized, the burden fell of my chest.

**I think**.. it's mandatory to reflect our thoughts on a daily basis.
Lack of self-awareness is unhealthy and can even be a health risk when taken to the extreme.
I hope we can agree on that without me having to write an essay on it.

**It took**.. 1.5 hours writing the Morning Pages and summing up my thoughts in the raw journal entry (I've cut half of it for this post).
It's mainly for myself, but I'd be glad if it helps out someone else.

**I want**.. to be more mindful what's going on in my subconscious.
