Lesson of the week:
If you can, do code your own theme.

I've been trying to tune my site lately.
I've also been creating a new site and decided to use existing templates.
Turns out they're coded really bad (at least to my expectancies.)

Trying to extend them is really hard.
There're a lot of instances in which I think the author could've introduced modularity.
A lot of instances in which code might've been reused or split.

I'm the last dev to go reinventing the wheel instead of using available (awesome!) open source projects.
However, from this day on I strive to build my own themes instead of endlessly looking for "the perfect one" and being possibly frustrated by the lack of code quality.

I at least know who to blame and strive to improve if my coding quality falls short.
Also, it's time to build a nice portfolio of projects to showcase ðŸ˜Ž.
