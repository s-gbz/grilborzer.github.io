Welcome to part two of my journaling series (I think there might be ten in total).
Feel free to breeze through the headlines and highlights as there wasn't anything groundbreaking. 

# "Exploring ideas that come up" - 18.07.2020
**I feel** .. tired. Probably because of yesternight's wine.
I am motivated to tackle the day though (it's 1 PM LOL).

**I think** .. about ideas that came up during the writing session.
I consider how to handle them most efficiently.

Morning Pages are highly individual.
I like **recapping the day and drifting into ideas** that come up.
This approach has an inherent problem:
There's a limit of three pages.

A compromise might be **exploring the idea briefly and** then tracking it somewhere else to **come back later**.
I think that worthwhile thoughts can be stored away safely if their essence is captured in time.

**It took** .. 45 minutes today.

**I want to** .. have some coffee, decide on one of my many drafts to finish, clean the house and watch a nice movie afterwards.
I'm thinking Akira or Nightcrawler.
(It turned out to be Nightcrawler!)

# "The third page was hard, but worth it" - 19.07.2020
**I feel** .. tired, because I first spent two hours preparing and eating the most perfect pancakes and two hours meticulously scrubbing the bathroom afterwards.
(Cleaning the bathroom was _not_ related to my breakfast)
Anyways, the day started well so far!

**I think** .. about a potential topic for a blogpost - "**Handling Fight or Flight as a developer**".
I'm also thinking about a little project to catch **spelling mistakes in Markdown** files.
Is there such a GitHub Action/ CI component?

**It took** .. 45 minutes today.
Transitioning onto the third page required a bit of **imagination** today, but **it was worth it**.

**I want to** .. finish and publish my recent draft on mindfulness today! (Wow, the exclamation mark means I'm serious)

# "Is it better to write at home?" - 20.07.2020
**I <s>feel</s> felt** ..  irritable, because I didn't have breakfast, started writing in a shaky bus and had to finish writing at my work desk.
I was rather easy to set off in the time between.

**I think** .. it **might be** a **better** idea to dedicate time **to write at home**.
Being stressed to finish defeats the purpose.

**It took** .. 35 minutes with 30 minutes between the two sessions.

**I want to** .. figure out if I was solely irritable, because I got up at six o'clock instead of seven like yesterday.

# "Morning Pages can be about anything" - 21.07.2020
**I feel** .. relaxed and more insightful.
Todayâ€™s writing process was harder though.
I actually struggled to find content after the first page was filled.
It helped to remember that **Morning Pages can be about anything**.
So, I **wrote a letter** to myself.
It was really insightful and long due.

**I think** .. that **I might enjoy the Morning Pages, because I feel the need to write in general**.
Time will tell how the pages are spent.

**It took** .. me about ~45-50 minutes, because I tried to make the letter compact and express myself properly.

**I want to** .. learn more about the craft of writing.
