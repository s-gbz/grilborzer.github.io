Is this movie receiving praise like Donnie Darko, Fight Club and Shutter Island?
If not, it better be - quickly!

# Terrifying, fear inducing
Black Swan had me sweating, (softly) screaming and sinking into the seat.
Our protagonist Nina is shy, fragile and a quiet, yet ambitious dancer on a noisy stage.
Watching her interact with loud, powerful and uncalculatable characters is uncomfortable at its own.
Add a shaky, hand captured camera movement and receive a crawling paranoia in each of Ninas interactions ("no don't go there you'll get hurt!").
Include unreliable narrative, quick cuts, some CGI and experience terror that is rather unexpected from a "Drama, Thriller".
Part of the editing is reminiscent of director Darren Aronofsky previous work "Requiem for a Dream". 

To put plain, Black Swan had me like **"OMG WHAT IS HAPPENING, PLEASE STOP"**.
It was a shocking, frightening, simply physical experience - "Viewer discretion advised".

# Can you trust anyone?
Ladies first:
Nina has a strained relation with her **mother** Erica (Barbara Hershey).
I found myself putting a label on her just to replace it the next time.
"Manipulative, caring, obsessed, supportive" - who's to tell?
Humans are complex and so was she.

**Lily** (portrayed by Mila Kunis) was scary.
What's her goal?
Is she helping?
Can we trust her?
Many questions with few answers - just as we like it!

At least Ninas boss **Thomas** (Vincent Cassal) didn't leave me panicking.
He's on a fine line between inspiration and abuse, but he does balance well.

Fun fact: I was pleased to find out that Heathers star **Winona Ryder** is on board!

# Conclusion
I can't remember the last time a movie took me one a ride such as Black Swan did (actually I do, it was [The Lodge](/blog/the-lodge-review/)).
Most definitely give it a watch if you like mysterious movies like Donnie Darko, Fight Club and Shutter Island (the list goes on).

Take notice that **Black Swan is highly thrilling** unlike the rather "calm" examples I mentioned - 
finally a movie that pays its genre tribute!
